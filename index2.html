    <h3>Chapter One</h3>
    <p>
      <sup>1</sup>In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth,
      <sup>2</sup>the earth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the
      abyss, while a mighty wind swept over the waters. <sup>3</sup>Then God
      said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
